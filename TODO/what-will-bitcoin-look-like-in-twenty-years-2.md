# 二十年后比特币会变成什么样？-第二部分

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*9cntgSCQQES9fogbSwWIoQ.jpeg)

### 比特币，加密技术和去中心化技术的兴起

我们将开始一些简单的预测,并逐渐的进行一些更加复杂的和遥不可及的预测以及一些对这些预测严肃的讨论。

我也将包括一个信心表，让你们知道，这种预测场景的发生我有多强烈的感觉。

### 1) 泡沫破裂

经常关注加密技术的一群人把它看做泡沫，迟早会破裂，造成价格崩溃。

**他们是对的**

**但是那又怎样？**

**这不是故事的结束，恰恰相反，这是故事的开始.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*kwdBoz8WFuqp5Q61nQk5_g.jpeg)

现在，我们正沉浸在比特币收益带来巨大的快感当中。这里有很多潜在的风险。我们几乎可以预测分布式技术的未来。近在咫尺！现在的任意一天都有可能发生。

当然，毫无疑问，泡沫的破裂并不能解决问题。 **泡沫将会破裂** [**Vitalik 是对的. 90% 的虚拟货币将失败**](https://coinjournal.net/vitalik-buterin-90-icos-will-fail/)**.**

但是，泡沫破裂以后才能给区块链技术带来真正有用的想法。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*GDW2WTPat06YRs5uNxxiEQ.jpeg)

**8年加密技术经验，每个人工作在未来铁路的轨道上，但是我们没有太多东西可以拿出来展示，除了投机交易和一些精明的合约。** 用这种技术做成应用程序是十分可怕的，并且几乎无法使用。 这是需要很大勇气去通过网络“发送”$5000给某个人。 最好祈祷你的复制，粘贴的地址是正确的，这才能保证你的钱才不会消失！

彼时互联网泡沫破碎的时候，很多今天的巨头公司经历了股价蒸发85%。 它们幸存下来了并且最好的事情也发生了。Amazon和Google支配了全世界。

**加密技术也会是同样的情况**

**有10%的项目通过市场的洗礼，将会变成明天的亚马逊，谷歌和Facebook，甚至可能是摩根大通和高盛，更不用说甚至是未来的政府，譬如数字民主，或者液态民主。**

发明家夜以继日的努力工作。真正创造一个理论存在，而真实不存在的东西！

这里没有指南，没有模板，没有业务逻辑可以克隆。什么也没有。你就是你自己！这里仅仅有你和你的想象。有这么奇怪的特性，当然有90％的人和公司会失败了！

不过这不是问题。

[**加密，区块链和第三方支付可能是过去500年来最重要的发明**](https://hackernoon.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-important-invention-in-the-last-500-years-c90b0151c169) **因此所以他们不会温柔地进入那个美好的夜晚。（这里形容过程曲折）**

泡沫破裂是下一步。 三年后，这个技术才会真正的成熟然后高速发展。

### 2) 政府的加密货币将繁荣

大众可能不喜欢这一条，但是这不是闻风而动。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*kwdBoz8WFuqp5Q61nQk5_g.jpeg)

**很多政府将不会坐视不管，如果不进行恶意斗争就会丧失对供应货币的控制能力。任何正在从事这方面工作的人应该预测对区块加密技术协议级的攻击，并针对这些攻击进行设计防御措施。**

分布式，去中心化的DDoS防御手段, 像 [**Gladius**](http://gladius.io) 是很好的起步，但是这里仍然有很多事情要做。我们将讨论一些额外的防御手段，就是当协议变革的时候，我们的加密技术能够幸存下来。

也许在30到100年左右（也许更快，取决于有多少次金融危机），政府将在长期的战斗中失败。这让我们将在这场比赛中幸存下来，不要用核弹炸自己，把它送到太空去。但是，在十或二十年预计会有一个非常强势的政府加密货币为世界各地的很多人控制的现金流。

"但是没人会采用它们！"加密技术忠实的呐喊!

当然，它们将被人们采用。

普通人并不理解加密货币真正重要的事情，并且他们也完全不需要隐私和安全，直到在很极端的情况下，像战争，剥夺了他们的身体。当士兵入侵了你的房子,并拿走了你的一切，在那一刻才会真正的需要隐私，从而变成一个真正的人。

记得斯诺登在John Oliver的脱口秀中对政府监控的采访吗？

看看斯诺登的表情，他意识到街上的普通人一点也不关心他们自己的隐私！他们只关心自己的私处(dick)照片是否被存到政府的硬盘里。

人们采用了政府的加密货币像一个小绵羊一样没有任何其他的想法。甚至，他们认为这绝对是一件十分正确的事情，如果被告知是正确的事情，他们甚至愿意为此而杀人！

当然，在很多方面政府会说加密货币是可笑的，正如Naval Ravikant在在史诗般的区块链tweetstorm中指出:

![XEX0H$32R3VW`LS%2DV]UWU.png](https://i.loli.net/2017/11/07/5a0161a24d8f7.png)

**他们是无稽之谈，因为区块链的目的是通过系统分配权力。** 通过不允许单个组织任意地控制或更改规则, **去中心化加密技术和应用程序提供了一套强大的检查和平衡机制，以防止对系统的有害操作。**

当五个不同的银行拥有区块链时，这不是区块链，而是一个数据库。 只有当银行，监管机构，股东和客户同时拥有区块链的钥匙，才能抵消彼此的力量，才是真正的区块链。

**对权利的检查和平衡才是真正的要点。!**

政府加密货币的想法将完全代表腐败。

但是这不是问题。他们会做到这一点采用任何方式。

事实上，他们不是分配权力，而是集中更多的权力，让自己有能力不费吹灰之力跟踪每一个公民的支出，并自动从工资和销售货物和服务中征税。 这就是为什么独裁政府正在竞相建立官方的密码。 他们迫不及待要尽快在你的口袋里放置全景图。**

他们将绝对会取缔实物现金，他们会以三个借口之一的幌子来做:

*   防止洗钱
*   防止恐怖袭击
*   防止犯罪

当然，知道你在亚马逊上花了一半的工资，杂货和房租与这些东西没有任何关系，但是嘿，如果你抛出了上述任何一个或所有的原因，你可以很容易地让其他人做你想要所做的一切，甚至更好的情况是，他们会全心全意相信。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*etJecOqa4iPT5GpdrDtEng.jpeg)

记住美国心理学家 [古斯塔夫•吉尔伯特（Gustave Gilbert）在纽伦堡审判期间与纳粹赫尔曼•戈林（Neri Hermann Goering）的谈话?](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring)? 戈林告诉他，大多数人会毫不犹豫地跟相信他们的领导人所说，无论是民主还是法西斯独裁。

天真地，Gilber回答说："有一个区别。 在一个民主国家，人民通过他们的民选代表就可以发言，而在美国，只有国会可以宣战。"

但是，戈林只是笑了起来，说："哦，这是很好的，但是，选举或者没有选举， **人们总是可以被领导说服。这很容易。你所要做的就是告诉他们，他们将要找到袭击，并谴责和平主义者缺乏爱国主义，使国家面临危险。 它在任何国家都很有效。**”

政府的加密货币，对于对加密技术执着的人来说，将是一个非常痛苦的药丸，但是，这些执着的人会很好的尝试习惯它们。

一个更好的选择是假设会有去中心化和中心化加密的混合系统，并且为了避免在金融海啸中被吞没而设计它。最好是用区块链技术接受现有的系统，然后从内部感染它而不是忽略它，这样就会变得很难对付。

### 3) 去中心化加密货币将变成这个星球的一个平行的经济操作系统

仅仅因为中心化密码技术体现了突出优势，并不意味着去中心化密码技术将会消失。哦，很多国家的政府都会去尝试，但最后他们还是不能把它们剔除出去。 原因很简单。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SauOTxerkM449xCtL2aBtQ.jpeg)

**The same factors that make it hard to form consensus across a blockchain, make it hard for all the world’s governments to agree on anything.** They won’t be able to do it. Some governments will love decentralization and others will hate it.

Even as some countries openly rail against them, many others will **openly embrace decentralized cryptocurrencies, especially the ones who suffered the worst under the dominance of Europe and the US dollar over the last century.**

I see the Latin American countries, freewheeling no-holds-barred globalists like Singapore, historical bankers-to-the-world Switzerland and many of the Asian and African countries welcoming decentralized crypto with open arms, if only to stick it to the current empires.

If all the countries don’t agree, then decentralized cryptos are never going away, even as centralized cryptos come to power.

But to remain relevant, decentralized cryptos need to move fast. **They need a killer app.** Right now they’re vulnerable to attack. **To really take root they need that killer app to spread virally across the globe.** It’s got to be something so indispensable that people can’t imagine their lives without it. This will bring existing power players into the system and they will then use that power to defend it against attacks from outside powers.

I outlined one of the ways that can happen in my article for [**gamifying the distribution of money**](https://hackernoon.com/gamifying-the-delivery-of-money-c55c25cecaee). But that’s just one way it can play out. There are many, many more. If you’re working on a platform now, know that it’s a race against time before central cryptos take root.

### 4) The Killer App for Crypto is NOT a Browser

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SauOTxerkM449xCtL2aBtQ.jpeg)

This is a classic example of grafting old inventions onto a new system. The [**Brave Browser**](https://brave.com/) is awesome and I bet I’ll really love it as it gets paired with [**BAT**](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) and/or a **universal payment system that** [**automatically swaps cryptocurrencies**](https://themerkle.com/what-is-an-atomic-swap/) without the need for an exchange but I don’t see it as the final interface to the blockchain. I see it as a potential intermediate step.

So what does the killer app look like?

I don’t know.

But I know it is:

*   **Ubiquitous**
*   **Easy to use**
*   Acts as a **platform** for everything from changing money to getting tickets to protecting privacy and information.
*   **Open source**

It’s also something totally new and original that expands and extends the best characteristics of the blockchain while minimizing its greatest weaknesses.

Maybe a decentralized AI assistant or attention filter? The possibilities are endless so get moving!

### 5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of Decentralized Consensus

Blockchain systems are only the first successful implementation of decentralized consensus mechanisms.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*kwdBoz8WFuqp5Q61nQk5_g.jpeg)

People are already inventing new ones like [**IOTA’s Tangle**](https://iota.org/) and the [**HashGraph**](http://hashgraph.com/).

It doesn’t really matter if both of those projects prove failures in the long run because some other project will create another method. This is virtually guaranteed.

Over the next twenty years, I predict dozens, if not hundreds of experimental distributed consensus protocols, capable of transaction levels that blow away Visa level processing, augmented by artificial intelligence systems.

It’s also strongly possible that none of these systems will be designed by humans.

Instead AI’s will rapidly iterate on ideas and come up with systems that no human ever could if they had a hundred years. They’ll draw their inspiration from nature and systems of insects or roots or other biological systems like proteins.

One or two of these systems will come to dominate all coins and become the meta-system to rule them all, uniting many different kinds of coins and running the entire system like a massive fractal that enables countless daughter networks to flourish inside of it.

### 6) Crypto Will Get a LOT Easier to Use

Today’s user experience in crypto is awful.

If I mistype something or copy and paste wrong, my money disappears forever. If there’s a software glitch I lose my money forever. If someone hacks my computer or phone my money is gone forever.

See a trend there? Make any mistake you’re toast. It’s like driving a motorcycle on the edge of a one inch mountain road with no rail.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*kwdBoz8WFuqp5Q61nQk5_g.jpeg)

The core wallets are slow, hard to use and ugly. When I last upgraded Ethereum, it forgot to keep my private keys so I had to go restore them all. Earlier this year I had an old Bitcoin stuck in an ancient version of Multibit from 2013\. It took me a week to free it after the software mistakenly thought I had sent a transaction that was never actually broadcast.

Imagine these wallets going into cold storage and coming out five years later. Will they even be usable? What happens when quantum computers come out and we need to completely update the basic protocols that underscore the system?

The average person will never be able to do these procedures. Zero chance. Two decades in IT taught me that people can and will screw up their machines in ways that are utterly unimaginable to tech people. Murphy’s Law rules.

Even worse, there’s no way to reverse any transaction or to secure it against mistakes. I foresee many _algorithmic methods_ to freeze, roll back and protect transactions, as well as ways to self-escrow money and recover stolen money. Think of them as automated versions of calling the bank and declaring a card stolen.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ZJuCf81drd-6hQiHGB0-Ug.jpeg)

If grandma can’t do it, forget it. Everyone is not an IT person who can bang away at the Linux terminal.

**Only systems that provide all the features of the old system _plus brand new features_ achieve mass adoption.**

Think about CD-ROM books from the 80’s again. They had a bunch of new features, like charts and color and you could back them up.

But it wasn’t good enough because CD’s had fatal flaws. **Ray Kurzweil** calls this the “[false pretender](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/402705/kurzweils-rules-of-invention/)” phase of evolutionary development in his book [**_The Singularity is Near_**](http://amzn.to/2ihZKeQ)**_._** The new tech has some advantages but too many disadvantages to really make it with the wider world and replace the old technology.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*7n8RXqspp7bLnZq_6_CT7g.jpeg)

It wasn’t until Kindles and iPads came along that eReaders had all the old features of reading a book, such as portability and being easy on the eyes, plus new features like the ability to carry a thousand books with you at once, something no dead tree could compete with, that it could really take off.

Cryptos must follow a similar path from fatally flawed to bringing untold new powers to people and businesses to acheive world dominance.

I also see many of the kinds of systems we really need arising from the desire to pass digital money down to your children. For that we will need ad-hock banks formed with groups of people as needed or algorithmic banks and bullet proof multi-signature wallets with decentralized cloud or foglet services to act as the final arbiter.

It won’t be enough to simply shard up your keys and give them to trusted friends or loved ones. That is a first pass solution. Friends stop being friends, people get divorced or die or worse. We need something better and completely automated.

**Think about how hard it would be to pass your Bitcoin down to your loved ones now.** What if you died tomorrow or got hit on the head and forgot your password?

Even if you plan for it, it kind of sucks too.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*WEH21y_aUF2W-dYtScGRjA.png)

You would have to create a will, lock a backup of your private keys and wallet in a safe, give the password to an estate lawyer and hope that he doesn’t make off with it or the USB stick or [**Trezor/Nano**](http://amzn.to/2iPesOp) doesn’t die. You could also create a multi-signature wallet with some friends and family members and [hope someone doesn’t check a different version into Github with a backdoor or bug and screw it up](https://blog.ethcore.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/). All of it is ugly and immature. It’s unacceptable.

**By the way, if you want to start a cyrpto business that everyone will need in the future, solve the inheritance problem.** Everyone will pay you gladly.

I foresee drag and drop smart contracts and AI generated wills with self-escrowing money. In essence, the blockchain itself will be the bank and the customer service department, perhaps using your biometric markers and third party proof-of-staked groups or a decentralized AI that can verify your loved ones, as well as trigger events like your end of days. Automated password and key recovery will be STOP.

**Whatever it looks like, we’ll need algorithmic approximations of the controls we have now for giving money to people we want and keeping it out of the hands of people who want to rob us.** We also need the system to protect us from accidents, death and going nuts.

### 7) The protocols of Coins will Get Abstracted from the Coins Themselves

Right now all the coins that exist are inextricably bound to their protocols.

**I expect us to abstract away the protocols for exchanging, sending and receiving as well as securing, defending and storing our coins.**

This will mirror the evolution of today’s servers from bare metal to virtualization to containers to serverless.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*kwdBoz8WFuqp5Q61nQk5_g.jpeg)

To start with, most coins can’t scale. We can’t even come close to hitting Visa level transaction processing on chain, the holy grail of any crypto system and the subject of much in-fighting and controversy. [Bitcoin can do 7 transactions per second at its peak](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability).

Some people have gone so far as to consider this a virtue of the coin as it encourages people to save and store it rather than send it.

That’s just absurd.

We should be able to move the coin as fast and as far and as often as we like.

Let’s face it, the 1 MB limit is nothing but a hack. **Originally Bitcoin had no limit.** Then Satoshi snuck it in overnight with no mention of it and no explanation in the source code. It was most likely nothing but a ham-fisted way to prevent DDoS attacks.

**We can and will come up with better flooding protections.**

Are you a 1MB adherent? How about SegWit2X’s 2MB? Maybe you go for Bitcoin Cash’s 8MB block?

Wrong. All of them wrong and ridiculous.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*-zUw0FetF3A2VSHuLCfrMw.png)

According to the folks at the [**Lightning Network**](https://lightning.network/) if we had seven billion people doing a mere two transactions a day it would take:

*   **24 GB blocks**
*   **3.5 TB/day**
*   **1.27 PB per year**

We need to think differently and evolve beyond petty nonsense to design real solutions. To survive Bitcoin and crypto must change. It’s got to be easy to integrate new defenses, newer cryptographic algorithms when quantum computers come knocking and better speeds and innovations.

We can’t just rest on the laurels of the Satoshi vision and assume he thought of everything.

He didn’t.

And frankly, who gives a fuck what Satoshi thinks? He left the project. If he really wanted to guide it he could have stuck around like Linus did with Linux. But he didn’t. He left it up to the rest of us to figure it all out.

So let’s really start to do that because the current system won’t stand or will just become dominated by mega-payment processors just like the system we have right now.

One way to do that is to abstract all the protocols and run all the older coins as something equivalent to virtual machines or containers. Then the rules are separate from the coins themselves.

That’s just one way, but to really become the promised breakthrough technology, blockchain needs real innovation.

Either way, people need to think quick, or we’ll still be debating 1 MB versus 2 MB while the CryptoRuble and CryptoYuan blow past us.

We’ll also need this because it will become necessary to defend against hostile actors and [APTs (advanced persistent threat)](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/anatomy-of-a-cyber-attack.html) protocol level attacks. Think the Great Firewall of China attacking or blocking transactions by screwing with packets and headers with [state level man in the middle attacks](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/deconstructing-great-firewall-china/). The [**NEM** architecture](https://nem.io/technology/) is a good first step, as it includes firewall like protection for nodes.

But it needs to go further to stop even more insidious and devastating assaults and it can’t take fours years and a hard fork to implement the solution.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*bJYTzJyty17c8gla-poFTA.jpeg)

The best solutions will likely be **externalized security rule chains downloaded to all nodes in the network that act as intrusion detection, firewalls and protocol inspectors and AI based auto-evolving rulesets and countermeasures.**

Think [**Neuromancer’s**](http://amzn.to/2hp02Ry)[**ICE**](http://williamgibson.wikia.com/wiki/Intrusion_Countermeasures_Electronics).
